===Installation Notes===
----

The pdelab binary should be located in the bin directory after executing the following build from the root pdelab directory:

_make_ _clean_

_make_


Before you execute this build, you must have the g++ (gcc) compiler.  This build has only been tested on a Mac OS X.  If you have problems with installation please post it under the Issues tab. I recommend adding the following lines to your .profile located in the home directory (Mac/Linux users only): 

_#Setting PATH for pdelab binaries_

_export PATH=$PATH:{root_directory}/pdelab/bin_
