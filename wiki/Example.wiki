Located in _pdelab/src/_ , Example is the parent class that all examples should extend.  If you open _pdelab/examples/1D/advec.h_ , you will notices that class advec extends Example.  This gives connects the unique advection solution to the Solver classes (SimSolver, Scripter, etc.) and thereby connects it to the Command Library.
